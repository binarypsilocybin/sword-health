### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Users can register on the platform
- User can logout of the platform
- Users registered on the platform can create content
- Users can create title, subtitle, content and category
- Users not registered can filter content
- Data is saved on localStorage

### Incomplete

I couldn't finish:

- Bookmarks
- Responsive design
- Hero Banner
- Role system
- Draft System

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- react v.18
- react-router
- react-toastify

### Overview

I started off with a solution for the problem and then I decided for other solution using VUE. I then realized that I could simply use react router for the login.

### Run the project

```
npm run dev
```
